# s3bro! A handy s3 cli tool
=============================
============
Overview
============
It's your s3 friend (bro). You’ll often find yourself having to run complex CLI/AWS commands in order to execute tasks against S3.  Let's say you need to restore all your keys from S3 Glacier storage class, if you’ve attempted this task, you’ve probably come to the realization, that the AWS CLI does not allow for an easy manner to execute this in “batch”.

Subsequently, you would need to make use of a combination of AWS CLI commands and pipe it to additional commands in order to obtain your desired result. In addition to this complexity, it would restore key by key, very slowly.

S3bro, however, offers you a solution to the above problem and others common situations where you have to run complex s3 commands, by utilizing multiprocessing/threading. This means that you can expedite tasks a lot faster than using the normal method. Oh, did I mention… in a much more elegant way. This is a python cli that will abstract a big portion of the work for you.

Why would you run the two following commands to wipe your bucket:

>>>
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket rsavordelli --output json --query
    'Versions\[\].\[Key, VersionId\]' | jq -r '.\[\] | "--key '\\''" + .\[0\] + "'\\''
         --version-id " + .\[1\]' |  xargs -L1 aws s3api delete-object --bucket rsavordelli
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket rsavordelli --output json --query
     'DeleteMarkers\[\].\[Key, VersionId\]' | jq -r '.\[\] | "--key '\\''" + .\[0\] + "'\\''
         --version-id " + .\[1\]' |  xargs -L1 aws s3api delete-object --bucket rsavordelli

if you can run this?

>>>
s3bro purge --bucket rsavordelli


what if you need to restore all your keys from glacier storage class? Or just some of them?

>>>
➜  ~ s3bro restore --bucket yourBucket --prefix glacier --days 10 --type Expedited --exclude .html --workers 10

From source

    ``git clone https://github.com/rsavordelli/s3bro ; cd s3bro``

    ``pip install -e .``


Note: For python3 you may have some issues due the unicode handling that has changed in Python3. The solution to these problems is different depending on which locale your computer is running in.
Generally "export LANG=en_US.utf-8" solves (put your LANG). More infos: http://click.pocoo.org/5/python3/
